 * Memory management of closures is "interesting" because we're keeping around
 * a JSContext* and then trying to use it spontaneously from the main loop.
 * I don't think that's really quite kosher, and perhaps the problem is that
 * (in xulrunner) we just need to save a different context.
 *
 * Or maybe the right fix is to create our own context just for this?
 *
 * But for the moment, we save the context that was used to create the closure.
 *
 * Here's the problem: this context can be destroyed. AFTER the
 * context is destroyed, or at least potentially after, the objects in
 * the context's global object may be garbage collected. Remember that
 * JSObject* belong to a runtime, not a context.
 *
 * There is apparently no robust way to track context destruction in
 * SpiderMonkey, because the context can be destroyed without running
 * the garbage collector, and xulrunner takes over the JS_SetContextCallback()
 * callback. So there's no callback for us.
 *
 * So, when we go to use our context, we iterate the contexts in the runtime
 * and see if ours is still in the valid list, and decide to invalidate
 * the closure if it isn't.
 *
 * The closure can thus be destroyed in several cases:
 * - invalidation by unref, e.g. when a signal is disconnected, closure is unref'd
 * - invalidation because we were invoked while the context was dead
 * - invalidation through finalization (we were garbage collected)
 *
 * These don't have to happen in the same order; garbage collection can
 * be either before, or after, context destruction.
