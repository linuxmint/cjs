 CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES
 NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE
 AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION
 ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE
 OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS
 LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION
 OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER.
 .
 Statement of Purpose
 .
 The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive
 Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent
 owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or
 a database (each, a "Work").
 .
 Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
 purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific
 works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims
 of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
 redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
 including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute
 to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production
 of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater
 distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.
 .
 For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation
 of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with
 a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
 and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work
 and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or
 her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended
 legal effect of CC0 on those rights.
 .
 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected
 by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights").
 Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:
 .
 i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
 and translate a Work;
 .
       ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
 .
 iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness
 depicted in a Work;
 .
 iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject
 to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
 .
 v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
 in a Work;
 .
 vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
 European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection
 of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any
 amended or successor version of such directive); and
 .
 vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
 based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.
 .
 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
 applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
 unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright
 and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
 known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
 action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
 duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions),
 (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv)
 for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising
 or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the
 benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's
 heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject
 to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
 equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
 as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
 .
 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
 judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
 shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's
 express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so
 judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non
 transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional
 license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i)
 in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable
 law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or
 future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
 including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes
 (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0
 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
 reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
 partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of
 the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will
 not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights
 in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with
 respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement
 of Purpose.
 .
    4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
 .
 a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered,
 licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
 .
 b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
 of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
 including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
 for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other
 defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable,
 all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
 .
 c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
 that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation
 any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims
 responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other
 rights required for any use of the Work.
 .
 d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party
 to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or
 use of the Work.
